# C-Flappy-Bird

This is a small program built with the C programming language.
It was created with
* **SDL2:** A C/C++ framework that supports OpenGL that is for rendering graphics and creating GUIs.
* **SDL2_Images:** A SDL2 module which let's you load in textures and images for your program.
* **C:** A programming language that is designed for speed, and compatability. It is handy for a wide range of things.
